# Sentiment analysis using Machine Learning and Lexicon approach !

Problem statement

Sentiment analysis is a task to identify the sentiment of customers using reviews given by them. In this project, the sentiment analysis problem of customers using office products on Amazon website has been handled using two approaches. In order to build models of this approaches customers’ reviews, summaries, and ratings are used as input data and model evaluation is done with the help of different performance measures of multi-class classification.

Dataset Origin

The data came from the Amazon 'office' product evaluation datasets, which can be found at http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/. This dataset comprises reviews of software products that have been used by several people.


## Required Libraries

The following libraries are required to be installed in the machine to run the python scripts. 
pip3 install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn nltk string textblob collections imblearn xgboost scikit-learn keras
